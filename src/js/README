Joystick interfaces are horribly non-portable.

Using conditional compilation on a line-by-line basis
became FAR too complex after more than a couple of OS's
were supported so now there is on standard interface header:

   js.h

...one set of common routines:

   js.cxx


...and a bunch of OS-specific code:


   jsLinux.cxx
   jsLinuxOld.cxx
   jsWindows.cxx
   jsBSD.cxx
   jsMacOS.cxx
