DESCRIPTION:

Pegasus is a C++ library for making networked games.
It includes event-driven channels, support for
buffering and pipelining, a monitor server for remote
telnet admin, and several design patterns including
a Yahoo-like game room.


ORIGINS:

Pegasus is based on Medusa, a high-performance internet
server architecture.

Medusa is mainly for Python -- a really great scripting language.
I wanted a C++ library which had the same simplicity as Medusa
and worked for the type of games i wanted to write.
I found a C++ port of Medusa and used that as a starting point.
I added my netRoom client-server design pattern and that
became Pegasus.

I use the name Pegasus because when Perseus (a son of Zeus) killed
Medusa by cutting off her head, from the drops of her blood sprang
Pegasus.  Pegasus was a winged horse who immediately flew up to
Heaven to live with the gods. He was said to carry the thunderbolts
for Zeus. lol.
