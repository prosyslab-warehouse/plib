Building SL for UNIX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your UNIX box is Linux or OpenBSD then
check out README.linux or README.openbsd.

If your UNIX box supports OSS (the Open
Sound System) then in principal, you should
only need to type:

  % make oss
  % su root
  % make install

...however, your milage may vary. If you succeed
in getting a non-Linux, non-OpenBSD version to
work, I'd like to hear about it.
