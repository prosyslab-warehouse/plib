Building SL for SGI.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two options, depending on whether you want to use GCC or
the standard SGI C++ compiler.

GNU G++:

   % make sgigcc
   % su root
   % make install

SGI C++:

   % make sgi
   % su root
   % make install

...that's all folks.

Header  files   go into /usr/include/SL (analogous to /usr/include/GL for graphics)
Library file(s) go into /usr/lib

When you link, be sure to include to -laudio
