<H1>The PLIB general Utility Library.</H1>
By Steve Baker
<H2>Introduction.</H2>
The 'UL' utility library is primarily targetted towards hiding common
operating system functions behind a thin layer that makes them portable.
<p>
For example, if you need to 'sleep' for 3 seconds, then under Linux/UNIX,
you'd need to call:
<pre>

  sleep ( 3 ) ;

</pre>
But under MS-Windows, you have to say:
<pre>

  Sleep ( 3000 ) ;

</pre>
In order to avoid writing non-portable code, you can instead call:
<pre>

  ulSleep ( 3 ) ;

...or...

  ulMilliSecondSleep ( 3000 ) ;

</pre>
...under either operating system.
<p>
One ultility function is:
<pre>
void ulFindFile( char *filenameOutput, const char *path, 
											  const char * tfnameInput, const char *sAPOM ) 
</pre>
Basically, it adds tfnameInput to the path and puts this into the buffer filenameOutput.
It handles special chars in path.
<code>sAPOM</code> is used iff path contains "$(APOM)"
These are the special chars:
<BR>
";;" is replaced by ";"
<BR>
"$$" is replaced by "$"
<BR>
"$(APOM)" is replaced by sAPOM
<BR>
If there are ";" in path, the path-variable is interpreted as several paths "segments",
delimited by ";". The first file found by this function is returned.
It looks from left to right.
A segment may end in $(...). ulFindFile will then look in in this path and recursively in all the sub-paths
<BR>
<BR>

Some examples:
<BR>
<BR>

To load *.MDl-models, it is very nice to set the texture path to
$(APOM);$(APOM)/texture;$(APOM)/../texture
This contains of three segments and tells ulFindFile to look in the 
path of the model, in a subpath texture and in a path texture "besides" the path of the model
Some *.mdl-models are shipped in a directory which conatins a "texture"-directory, a 
"Model"-directory and others. In this case you find the texture in $(APOM)/../texture
<BR>
<BR>

Another example: You have all your textures in a driectory-structure under /raumplan:
<pre>
textures --+-- Wallpapers
           |
		   +-- Wood --+-- Oak
           |          |
		   |          +-- pine
           ...
</pre>
Then you should simply use the following texture path:
"/raumplan/$(...)"
<BR>

If you dont want all of the bells and whistles, just call:
<pre>
_ssgMakePath ( filenameOutput, path, tfnameInput ) ;
</pre>
instead.
