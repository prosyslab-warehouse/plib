<H1>Portable Software using Portable Libraries.</H1>
I have been using my spare time to build a set of OpenSource (LGPL) libraries
that will permit programmers to write games and other realtime interactive
applications that are 100% portable across a wide range of hardware and
operating systems. Here is what you need - it's all free and available
with LGPL'ed source code on the web. All of it works well together.
<p>
    PLIB is also used by many projects, here are some of the more
    prominent ones:

<H2>Documentation.</H2>
All documentation is available online (click on the package name
in the section above) and distributed with PLIB in HTML.


<H2>Licensing.</H2>
PLIB is OpenSource software, issued under the terms of the
Library varient GNU Public License (LGPL).


<H2>Download</H2>
You can get PLIB in various versions here:
<ul>
<li><A HREF="dist/plib-1.3.2.tar.gz"> PLIB - Version 1.3.2 -- Experimental</A>
<li><A HREF="dist/plib-1.2.0.tar.gz"> PLIB - Version 1.2.0 -- Stable</A>
<li><A HREF="dist/"> PLIB - Other versions</A>
<li><A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=382"> PLIB - Latest development version (from CVS)</A>
(Use this for CVS versions of Pretty-Poly Editor).
</ul>
PLIB documentation, example programs, fonts, etc are now
separated from PLIB itself to cut your download times.
<p>
The <b>online</b> documentation is always for the latest version of PLIB,
which is usually the current experimental release.  If you are
using the older stable release, you may want to download the
documentation appropriate to that release.
<ul>
<li><A HREF="dist/plib_examples-1.3.2.tar.gz">
	     Example programs and Documentation for PLIB-1.3.2 or later.</A>
<li><A HREF="dist/">PLIB_examples - Older versions</A>
</ul>
Dump this into a separate directory from PLIB itself - or else
all the configuration and makefiles will clash. PLIB 1.0.xx has all
these examples and documents rolled into the main tarball.
<p>
I'm now using the even-version-stable/odd-version-experimental
version numbering scheme made popular by the Linux Kernel and
others. This means that PLIB 1.2.* will be stable
versions of PLIB that will only be changed to fix bugs. PLIB
1.3.* will be experimental versions that may or may not work
with your applications.
<p>
PLIB 1.0.* used to install itself into /usr/local/plib, but from
version 1.1.0 onwards, the default location moved to
/usr/include/plib (for header files) and /usr/lib (for
libraries). The library names also change to libplib*.a
instead of lib*.a as before.
<p>
This change was necessary in order that PLIB could be shipped
with Linux distributions - which do not generally install
anything in /usr/local.


<H2>Mailing Lists</H2>
There are three PLIB mailing lists:
In order to keep the spam off the lists, it's set up so you have
to subscribe in order to send mail.  To do that, visit:
<ul>
<li>
<A HREF="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/plib-announce">
  http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/plib-announce</A><br>
A very low traffic, heavily moderated list where I'll announce new versions
of PLIB.<p>
<li>
<A HREF="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/plib-users">
  http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/plib-users</A><br>
A list for PLIB users - this would be the correct place
to ask questions, report bugs and generally hang out with
fellow sufferers.<p>
<li>
<A HREF="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/plib-devel">
  http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/plib-devel</A><br>
A list for people who wish to contribute to the development
of PLIB - this list will have a high technical content and we'll
try to keep discussions there focussed and on-topic.<p>
</ul>
<p>
Please do not send me personal mail in situations when one of
the public mailing lists would be an appropriate forum - I hate
it when people do that.


<H2>Requirements for PLIB</H2>
To do good 3D graphics, you'll need an OpenGL-compatible 3D graphics
accellerator - and if you want to hear sounds, you'll obviously
need a sound card.
<p>
In addition, you'll need the following other libraries:
<ul>
<li>3D/2D Graphics: OpenGL. If you aren't already set up to
    run OpenGL, you should check:
    <ul> 
    <li> <A HREF="http://www.opengl.org">The OpenGL ARB</A> site.
    <li> Or download <A HREF="http://www.mesa3d.org">Mesa</A>
         (which is an excellent OpenGL clone by Brian Paul).
    <li> If you are a Linux user, you may wish to check the
         <A HREF="http://www.linux3d.org">Linux3D Site</A>.
    </ul>
<li>Windowing: <A HREF="http://www.opengl.org/Documentation/GLUT.html">GLUT</A>
    (The OpenGL Utility Toolkit by Mark Kilgard) - fully portable
    windowing library with support for mouse and keyboard.
    <p>
    There is also an OpenSource clone of GLUT called
    <A HREF="http://freeglut.sourceforge.net">freeglut</A> - it
    works very well with PLIB applications.
</ul>


<H2>Portability.</H2>
<ul>
<li> All flavors of Win32 (Win 2000, WinNT, Win95 and Win98) are supported, using either
     MSVC++ or CygWin for compilation.  Theoretically you could use Borland too,
     but I have no project files to help you build.
<li> All flavors Linux (presuming a 2.x.x series kernel) - on all platforms,
     although some problems have been reported on Alpha-Linux.
<li> Most other UNIX-like systems (at least BSD, IRIX, Solaris).
<li> MacOS now runs everything except the joystick library. I have yet to
     hear of anyone who has a Mac with a joystick - so this isn't a great loss.
<li> Support for BeOS is problematic - for some reason, people who are prepared
     to help out with porting PLIB to BeOS are hard to find. However, since
     BeOS (I'm told) runs X, OpenGL and OSS, it should be easy to port to.
</ul>


<H2>Installation.</H2>
On most Linux and other UNIX-like OS's, it's simply a matter of
unpacking the tar-ball, changing directory into the plib_x.y.z
directory and typing:
<pre>

   ./configure
   make
   make install

</pre>
Depending on the file permissions in /usr/local, you may need to
be 'root' to perform the last step.  At the end of that process,
you should have a set of header files in /usr/local/plib/include
and a set of corresponding libraries in /usr/local/plib/lib. There
are some example programs in the 'plib-x.y.z/examples' subdirectory.
<p>
WARNING: If you are using 'Mesa' instead of an 'Official' OpenGL,
please make sure you followed the instructions in the Mesa installation
notes that tell you to symbolically link /usr/lib/libGL.so
and /usr/lib/libGLU.so to their Mesa equivelents.  More modern
versions of Mesa may install directly into that location - but
make sure that one way or another, /usr/lib/libGL.so points to your
current OpenGL/Mesa library.
<p>
Some Linux distro's install OpenGL/Mesa in /usr/X11R6/lib - that
is now officially deprecated - if your OpenGL/Mesa is installed
there then I suggest you add symbolic links to make the
files appear to be in /usr/lib.
<p>
If you are running some non-UNIX OS, (eg MS-Windows) there may be
instructions on how to build PLIB in README.{OS name}.  If you
have problems - or can offer to streamline the
process, then please pass on your knowledge via the mailing list.
In general, it isn't complicated to install - you usually just have
to compile all of the source files in each directory and link
each subdirectory into a separate library. Don't try to make
PLIB into a M$ '.DLL' - it's not worth the effort!
<p>
If you have the Microsoft Visual C++ suite, you'll find a set
of project files - one in each source directory - plus a master
workspace at the top of the tree.
<p>
If you have all the Cygnus (CygWin) compiler/tools, then use
the UNIX build instructions.
<p>
There is now a README.mac for Macintosh users.
