<H1>Downloading and Installing PLIB.</H1>
<H2>The Short Answer (for Linux and CygWin users):</H2>
Make sure you have OpenGL and GLUT installed.<br>
Download this: <A HREF="dist/plib-1.4.0.tar.gz"> PLIB - Version 1.4.0</A>
<br>
Run this (as 'root'):
<pre>
     tar xzf plib-1.4.0.tar.gz
     cd plib-1.4.0
     ./configure ; make ; make install
</pre>
Tadaaaa!
<p>
<H2>The Long Answer: Downloading PLIB.</H2>
You can get PLIB in various versions here. We follow the common Linux
convention where the second digit in the version number is EVEN for
stable versions and ODD for unstable and/or experimental versions.
<p>
End users should generally download the latest stable version but
application developers may wish to periodically compile their code
against the odd-numbered version so as to keep abreast of developments
in PLIB.
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="dist/plib-1.5.0.tar.gz"> PLIB - Version 1.5.0 -- Experimental/Unstable</A>
<li><A HREF="dist/plib-1.4.0.tar.gz"> PLIB - Version 1.4.0 -- Current/Stable</A>
<li><A HREF="dist/plib-1.2.0.tar.gz"> PLIB - Version 1.2.0 -- Obsolete/Stable</A>
<li><A HREF="dist/"> PLIB - Other versions</A>
<li><A HREF="http://sf.net/project/?group_id=382"> PLIB - Latest development version (from CVS)</A>
</ul>
Download this using your browser by right-clicking on the name.  If you
have InternetExplorer, you'll probably fall victim to it's stupid bug
where it unzips the file automatically - but forgets to
rename it to lose the '.gz' off the end.  Just rename it yourself
before you try to un-tar it and all will be well.
<p>
PLIB documentation, example programs, fonts, etc are separated from
PLIB itself to minimise your download time.
<p>
The <b>online</b> documentation attempts to always track the latest stable
version of PLIB.  If you are using some other version, you may want to
download the documentation appropriate to that release which comes with
the plib_examples tarball.

<ul>
<li><A HREF="dist/plib_examples-1.4.0.tar.gz">
             Example programs and Documentation for PLIB-1.4.0 or later.</A>
<li><A HREF="dist/">PLIB_examples - Older versions</A>
</ul>
Un-tar this into a separate directory from PLIB itself - or else
all the configuration and makefiles will clash.

<H2>The Long Answer: Installing PLIB.</H2>
On most Linux and other UNIX-like OS's, it's simply a matter of
unpacking the tar-ball, changing directory into the plib_x.y.z
directory that this creates and typing:
<pre>

   ./configure
   make
   make install

</pre>
Depending on the file permissions in /usr/local, you may need to
be 'root' to perform the last step.  At the end of that process,
you should have a set of header files in /usr/local/plib/include
and a set of corresponding libraries in /usr/local/plib/lib. There
are some example programs in the 'plib-x.y.z/examples' subdirectory.
<p>
WARNING: If you are using 'Mesa' instead of an 'Official' OpenGL,
please make sure you followed the instructions in the Mesa installation
notes that tell you to symbolically link /usr/lib/libGL.so
and /usr/lib/libGLU.so to their Mesa equivelents.  More modern
versions of Mesa may install directly into that location - but
make sure that one way or another, /usr/lib/libGL.so points to your
current OpenGL/Mesa library.
<p>
Some Linux distro's install OpenGL/Mesa in /usr/X11R6/lib - that
is now officially deprecated - if your OpenGL/Mesa is installed
there then I suggest you add symbolic links to make the
files appear to be in /usr/lib.
<p>
If you are running some non-UNIX OS, (eg MS-Windows) there may be
instructions on how to build PLIB in README.{OS name}.  If you
have problems - or can offer to streamline the
process, then please pass on your knowledge via the mailing list.
In general, it isn't complicated to install - you usually just have
to compile all of the source files in each directory and link
each subdirectory into a separate library. Don't try to make
PLIB into a M$ '.DLL' - it's not worth the effort!
<p>
If you have the Microsoft Visual C++ suite, you'll find a set
of project files - one in each source directory - plus a master
workspace at the top of the tree.
<p>
If you have all the Cygnus (CygWin) compiler/tools, then use
the UNIX build instructions.
<p>
There is now a README.mac for Macintosh users.

<H2> Where Does PLIB Install Itself? </H2>
This is always a controversial topic.  In order to maintain
our own sanity, we expect PLIB to be installed in one place
and in one place only.
<pre>

  Libraries are in:    /usr/lib/libplibXXX.a

  Headers are in:      /usr/include/plib/XXX.h

</pre>
(Where 'XXX' is the short acronym for the PLIB library in question -
in lowercase).
<p>
The now *VERY* obsolete PLIB 1.0.* used to install itself
into /usr/local/plib, but from version 1.1.0 onwards, the
modern location was adopted following discussions with
several Linux distributors.
<p>
Please don't even <b>think</b> about arguing about this decision,
it has been the topic of long and arduous discussion and it's
NEVER going to change!
