This image was created entirely from ssgAux primitives.

</TABLE>
<p>
<H2>Conventions</H2>
ssgAux is installed and named with the same
conventions as the base PLIB libraries.
<br>
ie:
<pre>
   /usr/include/plib/ssgAux.h
   /usr/lib/libplibssgaux.a
</pre>
<p>
PLIB/ssgAux functions, classes and constants are all
named with an 'ssga' or 'SSGA' prefix.
<br>
eg:
<pre>
   class ssgaShape ;
   SSGA_TYPE_CUBE
</pre>
<A NAME="ssgaShape"></A>
<H1>ssgaShape</H1>
This is an abstract base class for many of the more
complex classes in the ssgAux 'collection'.  The idea
is that ssgaShape's are really ssgBranch nodes that create
their own child nodes - but they behave in such a way that
you are never concerned with the nodes they create beneath
themselves.
<pre>

class ssgaShape : public ssgBranch
{
  ssgaShape (void) ;
  ssgaShape ( int numtris ) ;
 
  float *getCenter  () { return center     ; }
  float *getSize    () { return size       ; }
  int    getNumTris () { return ntriangles ; }
 
  void setColour  ( sgVec4 c ) { sgCopyVec4 ( colour, c ) ; regenerate () ; }
  void setCenter  ( sgVec3 c ) { sgCopyVec3 ( center, c ) ; regenerate () ; }
  void setSize    ( sgVec3 s ) { sgCopyVec3 ( size  , s ) ; regenerate () ; }
  void setSize    ( float  s ) { sgSetVec3  ( size,s,s,s) ; regenerate () ; }
  void setNumTris ( int ntri ) { ntriangles = ntri ; regenerate () ; }
 
  void setKidState    ( ssgState *s ) ;
  void setKidCallback ( int cb_type, ssgCallback cb ) ;
 
  virtual void regenerate () = 0 ;                                              
}
</pre>
The constructor allows you to specify the approximate number of
triangles you'd like the shape to consume.  For some shapes, this
will be ignored (eg the Cube has 12 triangles - no matter how many
you ask for) - for others, it's honored only approximately (eg the
Sphere can only generate certain specific numbers of triangles) -
and for others, it may be honored exactly.
<p>
You can also set the colour of all the polygons and the ssgState and
callbacks that are applied to all of the child nodes.
<p>
setCenter allows you to position the center point of the object in
3D space - and setSize lets you determine the overall dimensions of
the object (this too may also be approximate - the 'size' of a teapot
is hard to specify in any useful way).  The version of 'setSize' that
takes an sgVec3 allow you to generate cuboids from cubes and sphereoids
from spheres...but not all shapes allow this.
<p>
The 'regenerate' call allows the complete child structure of the object
to be deleted and then recreated.  This is occasionaly useful if (for
example) you have walked down into the child structures and modified
them - and you'd like the shape back into it's pristine conditions.
<A NAME="ssgaCube"></A>
<H1>ssgaCube</H1>
<pre>

class ssgaCube : public ssgaShape
{
  ssgaCube (void) ;
  ssgaCube ( int numtris ) ;
  virtual void regenerate () ;
} ;
 
</pre> 
This is the simplest of ssgaShapes - it defines nothing new over
and above the standard ssgaShape.
<A NAME="ssgaPatch"></A>
<H1>ssgaPatch</H1>
<pre> 
 
class ssgaPatch : public ssgaShape
{
  ssgaPatch (void) ;
  ssgaPatch ( int numtris ) ;
 
  void setControlPoint ( int s, int t, sgVec3 xyz, sgVec2 uv, sgVec4 rgba ) ;
  void setControlPoint ( int s, int t,
                         float x, float y, float z,
                         float u, float v,
                         float r, float g, float b, float a ) ;
  void getControlPoint ( int s, int t, sgVec3 xyz, sgVec2 uv, sgVec4 rgba ) ;
 
  virtual void regenerate () ;
} ;
 
</pre>
This implements a basic spline patch - with a 4x4 grid of 'control points'
that define its shape.  'setContolPoint' allows you to set the spatial
position, the texture coordinate and the colour at any given (s,t) position.
(s and t each must be in the range 0..3).
<p>
It's necessary to call the 'regenerate' function whenever you have added
or changed one or more control points.
 
<A NAME="ssgaTeapot"></A>
<H1>ssgaTeapot </H1>
<pre>
 
class ssgaTeapot : public ssgaShape
{
  ssgaTeapot (void) ;
  ssgaTeapot ( int numtris ) ;
  virtual void regenerate () ;
} ;
 
</pre> 
This creates the 'classic' Martin Newell teapot model.
<A NAME="ssgaSphere"></A>
<H1>ssgaSphere</H1>
<pre>
  
class ssgaSphere : public ssgaShape
{
  ssgaSphere (void) ;
  ssgaSphere ( int numtris ) ;
 
  void setLatLongStyle ( int ll ) ;
  int  isLatLongStyle  () ;
  virtual void regenerate () ;
} ;

</pre>
There are two ways to generate a sphere model - one is to produce a
fairly uniform grid of triangles that are as nearly equilateral
as possible.  The alternative is to generate more nearly right-triangles
in cylindrical strips that are stacked on top of each other with a
circular disk at top and bottom.
<p>
The function 'setLatLongStyle(ll)' allows you to choose which you want,
call regenerate after you change types!
<A NAME="ssgaCylinder"></A>
<H1>ssgaCylinder</H1>
<pre>
 
class ssgaCylinder : public ssgaShape
{
  ssgaCylinder (void) ;
  ssgaCylinder ( int numtris ) ;
 
  void makeCapped ( int c ) ;
  int  isCapped   () ;
  virtual void regenerate () ;
} ;                                                                             

</pre>
Cylinders also come in two forms - capped and uncapped.  Once again,
if you change the capped versus uncapped status, call regenerate to
make the new version.
<A NAME="ssgaWaveSystem"></A>
<H1>ssgaWaveSystem</H1>
This class is for handling water waves.
It generates a large polygonal mesh which it distorts in
realtime to simulate water waves.
<p>
The simulation uses between one and sixteen "Wave Trains" - each
using a class:
<pre>

class ssgaWaveTrain
{
  ssgaWaveTrain () ;
 
  float getSpeed      () ;
  float getLength     () ;
  float getLambda     () ;
  float getHeading    () ;
  float getWaveHeight () ;

  void  setSpeed      ( float s ) ;
  void  setLength     ( float l ) ;
  void  setLambda     ( float l ) ;
  void  setHeading    ( float h ) ;
  void  setWaveHeight ( float h ) ;
} ;                                                                             

</pre>
So, you create a bunch of these trains (typically, two or three
is plenty to generate 'interesting' motion).
Each wave train has a direction in which the waves are travelling,
a speed, a wave length (which also affects the shape of the wave),
the height of the wave and a 'lambda' term (which controls how much
the tops of the waves bend over).
<p>
Next, generate the ssgaWaveSystem:
<pre>
 
class ssgaWaveSystem : public ssgaShape
{
  ssgaWaveSystem ( int ntri ) ;
 
  virtual void        regenerate  () ;
 
  ssgaWSDepthCallback getDepthCallback () ;
  void                setDepthCallback ( ssgaWSDepthCallback cb ) ;
 
  ssgaWaveTrain *getWaveTrain ( int i ) ;
  void           setWaveTrain ( int i, ssgaWaveTrain *t ) ;
 
  float getWindSpeed   () ;
  float getWindDirn    () ;
  float getEdgeFlatten () ;
  float getTexScaleU   () ;
  float getTexScaleV   () ;
 
  void  setWindSpeed   ( float speed      ) ;
  void  setWindDirn    ( float dirn       ) ;
  void  setEdgeFlatten ( float dist       ) ;
  void  setTexScale    ( float u, float v ) ;
 
  void updateAnimation ( float t ) ;
} ;

</pre>
The appearance of waves varies greatly with the depth of the
water - and this simulation produces the correct effects. There
is an optional user-callback that can be used to feed water depth
values into the simulation.  The wave system will likely call this
function many thousands of times per frame - so make sure your
depth function is very efficient.  If you don't provide a depth
function then the water will be assumed to be infinitely deep.
<p>
You can determine the number of polygons used to render
the patch of waves, the size of the wave patch and the amount
of texture repetition.  The 'EdgeFlatten' setting determines
to what distance from the edge of the patch the waves are
gradually flattened out.  This is useful because it allows
you to keep all those expensive wave polygons close to the
camera - and feather them out over range so that they blend
gently into a larger flat ocean.
<p>
Designing waves by calling the ssgaWaveSystem API is quite
difficult.  You are advised to use the wave designer program
in the PLIB examples package.  This program lets you adjust
wave parameters until it looks how you'd like - then hit the
'Write C++ code' to write out a source code snippet that you
can cut and paste into your program.
<p>
There is a 'README' in the 'water' source directory that
explains how to use the program in a little more detail.
That's all the wave system documentation I have time to write
just now - sorry.
<A NAME="ssgaParticleSystem"></A>
<H1>ssgaParticleSystem</H1>
This is a very flexible implementation of particle systems - it's not
as efficient as you might want for thousands of particles - this is intended
for high flexibility and relatively fewer numbers of particles.

<p>
All of that flexibility is evident in the complex constructor function:
<pre>

  class ssgaParticleSystem : public ssgVtxArray
  {
    ssgaParticleSystem ( int max ,          /* Max Number of particles      */
                         int init,          /* Number to launch initially   */
                       float add ,          /* Max number to create per sec */
                         int turn_to_face,  /* Turn to face camera?         */
                       float size,          /* Size of particles            */
                       float bsphere_rad,   /* Size of bounding sphere      */
      ssgaParticleCreateFunc create,        /* Initial create fn.           */
      ssgaParticleUpdateFunc update = NULL, /* Update function              */
      ssgaParticleDeleteFunc del     = NULL /* Remove function              */
                      ) ;

    void  setSize ( float sz ) ;
    float getSize () ;

    update ( float dt ) ;

    int getNumActiveParticles () ;
  } ;

</pre>
There are three callback functions - with the following types:
<pre>
 
  typedef void (* ssgaParticleCreateFunc) ( ssgaParticleSystem *ps,
					    int index,
					    ssgaParticle *p ) ;
 
  typedef void (* ssgaParticleUpdateFunc) ( float deltaTime,
					    ssgaParticleSystem *ps,
					    int index,
					    ssgaParticle *p ) ;
 
  typedef void (* ssgaParticleDeleteFunc) ( ssgaParticleSystem *ps,
					    int index,
					    ssgaParticle *p ) ;

</pre>
There is also a public class for a single particle:
<pre>
 
class ssgaParticle
{
public:
 
  sgVec4 col ;
  sgVec3 pos ;
  sgVec3 vel ;
  sgVec3 acc ;
 
  float size ;
  float time_to_live ;
  void *userData ;
 
  ssgaParticle () ;
 
} ;                                                                             

</pre>
This is best explained with an example.
Here is an example of a fountain model:
<pre>

  fountain = new ssgaParticleSystem ( 2000, /* Max Number of particles */
                                         2, /* Number to launch initially */
                                       200, /* Max number to create per sec */
                                      TRUE, /* Turn to face? */
                                       0.2, /* Size of particles */
                                      20.0, /* Size of bounding sphere */
                           fountain_create, /* Initial create fn. */
                           fountain_update  /* Update function */ ) ;
 
</pre>
This creates a system that has the capability to draw 2000 particles
(each is a quadrilateral).  Two particles are launched initially and 200
more are added gradually every second.  You can choose to have each particle
turn to face the camera - or to be oriented in the X/Z plane, mine are set to
turn-to-face.  The particles are 0.2 OpenGL units across.
<p> 
This fountain is a continuous effect - so the inital number of particles
to launch is small - and the 'per second' creation rate determines the
flow.  If you wanted something more like an explosion, have a larger number
of initial particles and none launched per-second after that.
<p>
One messiness is that we don't know how big the fountain may become over
time - and it's VERY inefficient to recompute the bsphere every frame. Hence
you have to tell the class what the maximum bounding sphere of the fountain
is at the outset so we can field-of-view cull it - this <b>could</b> be a near
infinite radius (MAX_FLOAT say) if you truly don't know how big it could
get - but that's inefficient because all 2,000 particles must be sent to
OpenGL even if the fountain is 20 miles away behind the camera - so do your
best to come up with some kind of a reasonable guess.
<p>
fountain_create and fountain_update are user-defined callback functions,
we could also have defined a 'fountain_delete' function - but many applications
won't need this.
<ul>
<li>The 'create' callback is called every time the system needs to
    create a new particle.
<li>The 'update' callback is called on every update cycle for every
    particle that's in flight.
<li>The 'delete' callback is called when the system has decided
    that a particle has 'died'.
</ul>
You have to have a 'create' function - but the other two are optional.
<p>
These callbacks are passed the address of the particle system, the index
number and address of the particle that's being created/updated/deleted -
and (for the 'update' function only) - the amount of elapsed time since
this particle was last updated.
<p>
The callbacks can set, read or change any or all aspects of the particle...
it's colour, position, velocity, accelleration, size and 'time to live'
(in seconds).
There is also a user data pointer - so you can hang your own data onto
each individual particle.
<p>
The particle system automatically moves each particle according to the usual
laws of motion and decrements it's time-to-live - so in many cases,
you can just set the initial velocity, the force due to
gravity and a reasonable time to live - and let the particle system code
do the rest.
<p>
My 'fountain_create' function looks like this:
<pre>

void fountain_create ( ssgaParticleSystem *, int, ssgaParticle *p )
{
  sgSetVec4 ( p -&gt; col, 1, 1, 1, 1 ) ;  /* initially white */
  sgSetVec3 ( p -&gt; pos, 0, 0, 0 ) ;     /* start off on the ground */
  sgSetVec3 ( p -&gt; vel, (rand()%1000-500)/300.0f,
                        (rand()%1000-500)/300.0f, 50.0f ) ;
                                        /* Shoot up and out */
  sgSetVec3 ( p -&gt; acc, 0, 0, -9.8f ) ; /* Gravity */
  p -&gt; time_to_live = 5 ;               /* Droplets evaporate after 5 seconds */
}

</pre>
It populates the particle with an initial colour, position, velocity and
accelleration and gives it a 'time to live' of five seconds.  The velocity
is randomised a bit to make a nicer looking fountain.
<p>
You can do all sorts of fancy things to the colour, position, velocity and
accelleration in your 'update' function.
<pre>

void fountain_update ( ssgaParticle *p )
{
  if ( p -&gt; pos [ 2 ] &lt; 0 )
    p -&gt; time_to_live = -1 ;
 
  p -&gt; col [ 2 ] = (p -&gt; time_to_live &gt; 2) ? 1 : (p -&gt; time_to_live/2.0f) ;
}

</pre>
...this one just erases particles that go below zero altitude (by
setting their time-to-live variable to -1) and makes them go a pretty
shade of yellow for the last two seconds before they die.
<p>
The 'delete' function is principally useful for freeing up any user-data
you allocated in the 'create' function or during 'update's.  Don't
delete the particle though - the particle system recycles it to avoid
doing too much dynamic memory allocation.
<p>
All that remains is to call the ssgaParticleSystem::update function
every frame with a parameter that tells the system how much time has
elapsed since the last call.  This allows you to easily speed up, slow
down or pause the particles (or even run them backwards if you want).
<p>
I call this every frame:
<pre>

void updateFountain ()
{
  static ulClock ck ;

  ck . update () ;
 
  if ( fountain != NULL )
    fountain -&gt; update ( ck.getDeltaTime () ) ;
}
                                                                                
</pre>
This function could also check the number of particles currently in flight
and delete the fountain when there are none left - that might be useful
for an explosion or something where you'd want to save CPU time by not
running the explosion particle system when all the pieces have landed
and 'gone away'.
<p>
The size of each particle is the size field of the individual particle
MULTIPLIED by the number you pass into the size parameter of the
ssgaParticleSystem constructor (or set with setSize()).  This allows you
to cheaply set the particle size for all the particles at once - or to
tweak the size of each one in turn.  The number in the particle structure
defaults to 1.0 so you can ignore it and just set the size in the
particle system overall.
<p>
ssgaParticleSystem is derived from ssgVtxArray - so you can apply textures and
other state things using the usual ssgVtxArray::setState(ssgSimpleState*)
call.  I applied a texture with a fuzzy alpha-blended circle.
<p>
While debugging this, I got a bug which caused a picture of Tux to be
applied instead of the droplet texture - it was absolutely hilarious
to see 2000 tiny penguins shooting up in a fountain and falling gently
to earth!
<A NAME="ssgaLensFlare"></A>
<H1>ssgaLensFlare</H1>
When you view the sun (or some other very bright light source) through
the imperfect lens of a camera, you get a row of bright circles and
rings in a line from the light source, through the center of the lens.
This is called a 'lens flare' and it can be very effective in computer
graphics in depicting a light source that's brighter than the computer
screen can display.  It almost makes you want to squint because of
the brightness.
<p>
The ssgaLensFlare object is a special kind of ssgaShape that can be
positioned beneath the same transform
as the source of the light - and it 'just works'.  You don't need
to set any parameters - just add it into the SSG scene graph in the
right place.
<p>
eg:
<pre>

   ssgTransform *myTransform ;
   ssgBranch    *myLightSource ;

   /* Set up myTransform and myLightsource */

   ...

   myTransform -&gt; addKid ( myLightSource ) ;
   myTransform -&gt; addKid ( new ssgaLensFlare ) ;

</pre>
It contains a (hard-coded) 256x128 texture map which is compiled
into the code and shared between however many lens flares there
are in the scene.
