<H2>PLIB Licensing.</H2>
PLIB is licensed under the Library GNU Public License (LGPL).
<p>
Whilst this permits closed-source applications to use PLIB, you
are bound by certain restrictions under LGPL.  Please be sure
to read and understant the 'LICENSE' file in the PLIB distribution
directory before you distribute any work based around or upon PLIB.
<p>
The PLIB example programs (being complete programs) are licensed
under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
<p>
Each of the demonstration programs has it's own license - but
they are all 'OpenSource' of one kind or another (as defined by
the SourceForge rules for OpenSourced software.  Check the
distribution directory for each one for a LICENSE file describing
how it's licensed.
<H2>Polite Request to Distributors.</H2>
If you are a Linux or other OpenSource software distributor,
please do us the courtesy of only releasing stable versions
of PLIB and NOT versions labelled 'unstable' - or (especially)
any snapshot you may take from CVS.  We are aware that legally,
you are entitled to do either of these things - but we ask
that you do not because it makes supporting PLIB that much
more difficult.
<p>
We would also appreciate being notified of which versions
you plan to ship - and approximately when so that we may
coordinate with you as to the best version to take.
