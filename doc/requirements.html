<H2>Hardware Requirements for Running PLIB</H2>
To do good 3D graphics, you'll need an OpenGL-compatible 3D graphics
accellerator that your operating system supports.  Most systems can
run OpenGL in software only - but performance is so poor as to be
unusable in the kinds of application for which PLIB is intended.
<p>
If you want to hear sound effects and music, you'll obviously
need a sound card and some speakers or headphones.

<H2>Software Requirements for Running PLIB</H2>
The PLIB team works hard to minimise our dependance on other
libraries to make it easy for end-users to install application
software without having to visit dozens of web sites to collect
the libraries they need.  
<ul>
<li>3D/2D Graphics: OpenGL. If you aren't already set up to
    run OpenGL, you should check:
    <ul> 
    <li> <A HREF="http://www.opengl.org">The OpenGL ARB</A> site.
    <li> Or download <A HREF="http://www.mesa3d.org">Mesa</A>
         (which is an excellent OpenGL clone by Brian Paul).
    <li> If you are a Linux user, you may wish to check the
         <A HREF="http://www.linux3d.org">Linux3D Site</A>.
    <li> If you are a Windoze or Macintosh user, you should have
         had a copy of OpenGL delivered with your operating
         system.
    </ul>
<li>Windowing: <A HREF="http://www.opengl.org/Documentation/GLUT.html">GLUT</A>
    (The OpenGL Utility Toolkit by Mark Kilgard) - fully portable
    windowing library with support for mouse and keyboard.
    As an alternative, there is an OpenSource clone of GLUT called
    <A HREF="http://freeglut.sf.net">freeglut</A> - it
    works very well with PLIB applications and is maintained by
    many of the same people.
    It's perfectly possible to write PLIB programs that don't use
    GLUT (for example, you can use PLIB with 
    <a href="http://www.libsdl.org">SDL</a>) - but the examples and demo's 
    do require it.
</ul>

<H2>How Portable is PLIB?</H2>
VERY!
<ul>
<li> All flavors of Win32 (Win 2000, WinME, WinNT, Win95 and Win98) are
     supported, using either MSVC++ or CygWin for compilation.
     Theoretically you could use Borland C++ also, but since there is little
     user base these days, the necessary 'project' files to build PLIB
     under Borland's IDE do tend to get outdated.
<li> All flavors of Linux are supported - on any CPU platform that
     supports Xfree86 and OpenGL.
<li> Most other UNIX-like systems (at least BSD, IRIX, Solaris, OS-X).
<li> MacOS now runs everything except the joystick library. I have yet to
     hear of anyone who has a Mac with a joystick - so this isn't a great loss.
<li> Support for BeOS is problematic - for some reason, people who are prepared
     to help out with porting PLIB to BeOS are hard to find. However, since
     BeOS (I'm told) has compatibility with GLUT, OpenGL and OSS, it should
     be easy to port to.
