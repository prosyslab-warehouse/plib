- Search for todo, fix, fixme, kludge.
  I would suggest we mark things we have looked at and want to 
  do later with "NIV14" or "NIV135".
- Document ssgStats, getNumLines and getLine.
- Document the new path handling and ssgLoaderOptions
- Any other new stuff that isn't documented yet?
- Check that all console output has been changed to ulSetError.
- AFAIK the define PROXY_TEXTURES_ARE_NOT_BROKEN is not yet added 
  to the makefiles.
  Fixed: Hardcoded it in the source. OK? /Marten
- Test all the examples and all the games+apps, that they compile.
  Besides the apps/games mentioned on the PLIB homepage, there is toobular.
- Testing on "non-standard" operating systems and hardware.
  Especially interesting are 64 bit machines. And computers with
  the other endianess (sp?). That means mainly MACs, doesn't it?
  Darrell, are you listening ;-)?
- Update docs to the new state:
  Change version numbers.
  Create change history (?).
  Change "In the cvs you will find" to
  "In 1.3.5 you will find"
- Do the file release
- Finalize and test the path handling.
