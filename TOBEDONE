  * Lines in ASCII files are terminated...

          With '\n' under UNIX/Linux
          With '\r' under MacOS
          With BOTH under Windoze.

    Hence, UNIX/Linux does no conversions of either '\r' or '\n'.
    and    MAC swaps '\r' and '\n' on input.
    and    Windoze dumps '\r' if it follows a '\n'.

    This is a mess - so I'm changing all the ASCII I/O code
    to allow either or both '\n' or '\r' and I'm reading the
    ASCII files in BINARY mode.
 
  * Array deletion requires '[]' after 'delete' on Mac.

  * Scaling really makes a mess of SSG bounding sphere tests

  * ssgLOS is really broken.

  * Some of the MSVC-project files for plib_examples seem to be 
    broken, for example some miss a "winmm.lib".

  * wk: Could someone, preferably a native english speaker, look
    over the new ssg-documentation?

  * Check whether the new ssgStripify works with TuxKart
