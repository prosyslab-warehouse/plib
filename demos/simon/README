====================

Which stands for:

     Simple
     Interface for
     Making
     Oliver's programs
     Nice.

This is a simple set of functions that hide much of the nastiness
of 3D programming to make it possible for someone with only the
very minimum of programming experience to write simple 3D applications.

Right now, you build SIMON by running 'make' and install it by
running 'make install' as root.  You must already have PLIB installed.
