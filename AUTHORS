PLIB was originally written by Steve Baker as a solo project - but
has subsequently been greatly enhanced and expanded by a 'cast of
thousands'.

Most important of all - the 'official' PLIB developers:

  Steve Baker        <--- Hmmm - must sort this list by SECOND name!

  Gil Carter
  John Fay
  Mark Vallevand
  Marten Stromberg

  Curtis Olson      (FlightGear guru and all-round "Mr Nice Guy",
                     who nagged me into writing most of this stuff!)
  Vasily Lewis      (Tireless maintainer and sysadmin at Woodsoup
                     where PLIB was first hosted)
  Toru Egashira     (Who wrote a program called 'NSPmod' which was
                     the original basis of the SL 'MOD' player -
                     although the original code has been almost
                     entirely rewritten in the process of merging
                     it with SL.
