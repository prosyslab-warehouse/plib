PLIB was originally written by Steve Baker as a solo project - but
has subsequently been greatly enhanced and expanded by a 'cast of
thousands'.

Special mention must go to:

  Daryll Strauss    (GLIDE port to Linux)
  David Bucciarelli (Mesa -> GLIDE interface)
  Brian Paul        (Mesa)
  Curtis Olson      (FlightGear guru and all-round "Mr Nice Guy",
                     who nagged me into writing most of this stuff!)
  Vasily Lewis      (Tireless maintainer and sysadmin at Woodsoup
                     where PLIB was first hosted)
  Toru Egashira     (Who wrote a program called 'NSPmod' which was
                     the original basis of the SL 'MOD' player -
                     although the original code has been almost
                     entirely rewritten in the process of merging
                     it with SL.
  Everyone at OPENGL-GAMEDEV-L and 3Dfx.glide.linux
