PLIB for Windoze.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let me first say that I (Steve Baker) don't own a copy
of Windoze - so I have little or no ability to help
Windoze owners with PLIB problems. It's especially
important therefore that you direct problems and
queries to the PLIB mailing lists.  Subscription
information is on the PLIB homepage:

   http://plib.sourceforge.net


CygWin:
~~~~~~~
The simplest way to build PLIB for Windoze is to
use the CygWin compiler and toolset.  Since that
environment is pretty close to UNIX/Linux, the

  ./configure
  make
  make install

...mechanism works perfectly.


MingW32:
~~~~~~~~
A couple of people have asked about doing a MingW32 port - but
as far as I can tell, the "configure/make/make install" approach
*should* work.


Microsoft Visual C++:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am distributing a set of MSVC project files for PLIB that
were kindly provided by Nate Robins. These are scattered
down to the source directories with a workspace set up 
in the PLIB root area.

Nate says:

> There is one dsp for each of the libraries, and for each of the example
> executables.  Internally the dsp's are set up so that they depend on each
> other (i.e., complex depends on pui and sg and fnt).  The plib.dsp contains
> _all_ the other dsp's (it is essentially an "all" or "default" target).  So,
> to build everything, select that project and build.

Borland C++:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Heil, David G. SDX" <DavidH@HPD.Abbott.com> contributed a set of
Borland bpg/bpr files. I know nothing more about what may be
required in order to use them.

     Steve.
