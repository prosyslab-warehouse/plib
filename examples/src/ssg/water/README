Designing Waves.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PLIB ssgAux library contains a class for handling
water waves.

   class ssgaWaveSystem ;

This generates a large polygonal mesh which it distorts in
realtime to simulate water waves.

The simulation uses between one and sixteen "Wave Trains" - each
using a class:

  class ssgaWaveTrain ;

The program in this directory demonstrates this system and allows
you to play with the wave train parameters.

Use the 'Edit Wave Train Number' widget to select which of the
16 wave trains you want to play with.  There is a button just
below that to enable or disable that particular wave train - and
for convenience, there is a button to disable ALL wave trains.

It's often convenient to turn on just one wave train at a time
and set it's parameters - then combine two, three or more to
produce the final effect.

Each wave train has a direction in which the waves are travelling,
a speed, a wave length (which also affects the shape of the wave),
the height of the wave and a 'curl' term (which controls how much
the tops of the waves bend over).

There are also controls to set the eyepoint pan/tilt/range and to
toggle the system into wireframe.

Finally, you can determine the number of polygons used to render
the patch of waves, the size of the wave patch and the amount
of texture repetition.
